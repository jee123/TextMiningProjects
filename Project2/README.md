How to run:
1.Run parta_partb.py to see :
 	 a)Number of documents in both groups(Computer Technology and Recreational Activity) and histogram of number of  
 	   documents per topic 
	 b)Final number of terms extracted.
2.Run TFICF.py to see :
	 c)The 10 most significant terms in the classes{'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware','comp.sys.mac.hardware','misc.forsale'  
	   ,'soc.religion.christian'}
3.Run d.py to see :
	 d)Reduced TFxIDF matrix.
4.Run linearSVM.py  to see:
	 e)ROC curve ,Confusion matrix ,Accuracy,Recall and Precision of Linear SVM.
5.Run SVM.py to see:
	 f)Optimal value of parameter Y,ROC curve ,Confusion matrix ,Accuracy,Recall and Precision of Soft Margin SVM.
6.Run naive_bayes.py to see:
	 g)ROC curve plot for different threshold values on class probabilities.Also find evaluated the Confusion matrix  
	   ,Accuracy,Recall and Precision of Naive Bayes Classifier.
7.Run LogisticRegression.py to see
	 h)ROC curve plot for different threshold values on class probabilities.Also find evaluated the Confusion matrix 
	   ,Accuracy,Recall and Precision of  LogisticRegression Classifier.
8.Run multiclass_ds.py and multiclass_classification.py to perform
	 i)Naive Bayes Classification ,multiclass SVM classfication(both One VS One and One VS Rest) and evaluate the 
	   Confusion matrix ,Accuracy,Recall and Precision of the Classifiers.
